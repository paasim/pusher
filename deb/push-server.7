.TH PUSH-SERVER 7
.SH NAME
push-server \- register subscriptions to push notifications.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B push-server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
A simple http-server that allows clients to register for push-notifications. The registrations are stored in sqlite database. See
.BR push-send (7)
for how to send messages. The required environment variables are:
.IP DATABASE_ENCRYPTION_KEY
used for encrypting client authentication secret
.IP DATABASE_URL
location of the sqlite-database
.IP PORT
port the server listens to.
.IP VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY
public part of the VAPID key
.P
In addition, if PUSH_SOCKET_ADDR is set, then the server allows for sending test
messages to a socket specified in the environment variable. This should match
the value set for
.MR push-send 7 ,
which would listen for these messages and pass them to the user.
.P
By default, the systemd unit defined in
.I /lib/systemd/system/push-server.service
reads the environment variables from
.IR /etc/pusher/push-server.conf .
